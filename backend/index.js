//What is Apollo Server?
// Apollo Server is a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema. It is built on top of the Apollo platform and provides a flexible and powerful way to build, deploy, and scale GraphQL APIs.
// Apollo Server supports various features such as schema stitching, data sources, caching, and subscriptions. It also integrates with popular web frameworks such as Express, Koa, and Fastify.
// Apollo Server is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing developers to build GraphQL APIs quickly and efficiently. It provides a simple and intuitive API for defining schemas, resolvers, and data sources, making it easy to get started with GraphQL.

// How to Use Apollo Server?
// To use Apollo Server, you need to install the apollo-server package using npm or yarn:
// npm install @apollo/server
// Then, you can create a new ApolloServer instance with your schema and resolvers:
// import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server";
